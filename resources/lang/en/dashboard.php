Welcome to " . config('app.name') . "! Your first campaign has been created and we have included a couple of example entities as inspiration (you can delete them whenever).

You'll probably want to get started by adding some entities of your own, so chose a category from the left and get started. You can disable unneeded categories of entity from the campaign settings, this will hide them from the menu.

A few tips to get you started:
- You can type @entityName to link to specific entities. The displayed link text will automatically update if you rename or update the linked entity.
- You can configure account specific settings like themes and entities per page in your profile, accessible on the top right.
- There is a growing list of tutorials on :youtube. Tutorials include attributes and how to share your campaign with other people. The :faq may also be useful.
- If you have questions, suggestions or just want to chat, join us on :discord",
